00:05.000 --> 00:07.000 align:left
Why am I here?

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
indeed, why?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
I may have grown roots..

00:13.000 --> 00:16.500
..that feeling, of belonging to a place

00:16.500 --> 00:19.000
I may have grown roots..

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
blueberries

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
let me think for a moment

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I miss this sky

00:30.000 --> 00:33.500 align:left
How does a human grow roots?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.000
Oh how?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.500 align:left
How does a human grow roots?

00:44.500 --> 00:46.000
Oh how?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000 align:left
How?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.000
umm.. how?

01:00.500 --> 01:03.000 align:left
How does a person grow roots?

01:04.500 --> 01:08.000
How, how, how, how, how?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
The sand at the beach

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Indeed!

01:13.000 --> 01:15.500
I find an artificial lake,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.500
that reflects the forest around it

01:16.000 --> 01:17.500
(on the other hand..)

01:18.500 --> 01:19.500
I LEFT.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
eeeuh...

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000 align:left
Why did you leave?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.500
Indeed... why?

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Sometimes I ask myself,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
what <i>is it</i> that I miss?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
(but then again...)

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
(I mean...)

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
<i>So</i> close by,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
but <i>so</i> far away...

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Yes, I am allowed to be here

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
eeeuh...

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000 align:left
Why do I feel so at home here?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000 align:left
Why do I feel so at home here?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000 align:left
Why do I feel so at home here?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Why indeed?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.000 align:left
Why?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Why am I <i>here</i>?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000 align:left
Why are you there?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500 align:left
Why are you there?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Why miss another place,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
when after all, one lives in a...

02:29.500 --> 02:31.500
(I pick...)

02:30.000 --> 02:31.500
place?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.500
(let me think for a moment)

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
mm-m!

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I found oregano

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I find a lake

02:41.000 --> 02:43.500
that reflects the forest around it

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
(ummm)

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000 align:left
what do I miss?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh, what do I miss?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Indeed!

03:02.000 --> 03:03.500
(krhm..)

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
indeed, what?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
yes, it's true

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
but it is quite cozy here..

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I am part of...

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
...all of this

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000 align:left
where is my place?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000 align:left
where is <b>my</b> place?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Where is life?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I think I may have grown roots...

03:32.300 --> 03:33.500
Why did I move here?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Did I move here?
